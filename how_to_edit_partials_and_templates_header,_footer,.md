# How to edit partials and templates (header, footer, content elements)

###Step 1

Create the folder structure in *fileadmin/templates/theme_t3kit* for the new file you want to edit.  
For example, if you want to change the header, find the original file (from git or within the project) and folder structure:
***theme_t3kit/Resources/Private/Partials/Header/*** 

Inside your new ***/Header/*** folder, create the new header with the same name as the original filename **"Header.html"**

Copy the content from the [original file](https://github.com/t3kit/theme_t3kit/blob/master/Resources/Private/Partials/Header/Header.html) and place it into your new "Header.html" file. 

###Step 2

Choose **"Template"** in TYPO3 menu
