# Development and production mode in t3kit.


**Development mode** is enabled by default. It keeps `CSS` and `JS` files separately and non-minified. It helps developers in code debugging and finding bugs and potential problems. Also, it **disables site indexing by search robots**, which is quite important in the development process when content is not added yet, and our new site is in testing mode.


**Production mode** should be enabled manually in a process of launching the site. With this mode, all `CSS` and `JS` files will be minified and concatenated, which is very good from web performance side. Also, it will open site for search robots.
