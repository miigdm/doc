Now we can see your IP from “IPv4 Address” line of current connection. This is, in our case, **192.168.9.130**.
Address for connection to local server, in this case, will be **http://192.168.9.130:9004/**
Livereload also will work on different devices. It means you can edit your site and see changes on all your devices without reload page.
