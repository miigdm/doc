# Static site

We have possibility to use static web server for every our project. It means we can quickly deploy site and discuss some questions with designers, others developers, PM etc. 
Use command grunt pushSite to automatically deploy site on our test server http://felayout_projectName.testserver.pixelant.nu/
Before using command grunt pushSite we should commit all changes on master brunch of local Git repo.
